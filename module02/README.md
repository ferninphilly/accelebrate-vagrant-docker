# Review from Module One

1. Create a new directory called **/Users/Administrator/myvagrantdir**

2. Change directories into that new directory using the powershell `cd` command and initialize a new Vagrant directory there.

From the main directory here find and download the most recent CENTOS/7 box from Vagrant using the `vagrant box` command to download the new vagrant image.

2. Build that box using the commands we reviewed from the previous module.
