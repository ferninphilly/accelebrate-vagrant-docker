# Review from Module One

1. Create a new directory on the host called **C:\Users\Administrator\vagrantexcerise01** using the git bash `mkdir` command.

2. Change directories into that new directory using the git bash `cd` command. 

3. Initialize a new Vagrant directory there.

3. From the main directory here find and download the most recent CENTOS/7 box from Vagrant (do a search for "bento, centos-7.2"- you did this at the end of the last lab) using the `vagrant box` command to download the new vagrant image.

4. Go into your Vagrantfile and edit it to use the box that you just downloaded.

5. Create a visual representation of the box in the vagrant file that will pop up when the machine is created.

6. Close the machine pop up. This will result in a requirement for a machine restart. Go ahead and restart the machine.

7. Enter the machine directly through the command line with the ssh command.

8. Run the command that stops the box from running but __does not destroy it__

9. Run the command to restart the box.

10. Suspend the box so that it remains in it's current state but does not run.

11. Destroy the machine.
